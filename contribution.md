## Contribution
I work at my pace and hopefully document most of the methods mentioned in [Methods](methods.sql), after that feel free to contribute. The working branch is develop, the master branch is for releasing documentation on github with cross-refs, cross-refs implemented with shitty python script, I may share it after for someone to improve.
